Game Features
1. Shops

    Main Shop: Spend gold to purchase stronger weapons and healing potions. A better weapon improves your chances in combat, and health potions can restore your health.
    Secret Shop: As you earn XP, you’ll gain access to a hidden shop where you can spend XP points on powerful upgrades for your weapon and armor. These upgrades can give you a significant advantage in tougher battles.

2. Combat and Exploration

    Forest: Start your journey by exploring the forest. The forest is a relatively safer area with less dangerous enemies like wolves. This is an ideal place to earn initial gold and experience points.
    Cave: Once you’re better equipped, you can enter the cave, which contains stronger and more dangerous creatures. The cave offers greater rewards but is also riskier, so make sure you’re well-prepared before venturing in.

3. Mini-Game: Guess the Number

    After each monster fight, you may discover a mini-game where you can earn bonus gold. In this game, you’ll need to guess if a randomly generated number will be odd or even. Guess correctly to win a 10-coin bonus! But be careful—if you guess wrong, you’ll lose 10 health points.

4. Final Boss: The Dragon

    Once you have enough health, weapons, and armor, you’ll be ready to face the dragon. Defeating the dragon is the ultimate goal of the game. Come prepared because this battle will be your most challenging one yet.

Winning and Losing Conditions

   Victory: You win the game by slaying the dragon.
   Defeat: If your health reaches 0 or below, the game ends, and you’ll need to start over from the beginning.
    
Enjoy the adventure, and good luck on your quest to slay the dragon!
